----------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains all the steps required to start the Project YU.

**********PREREQUISITES************

1. System must have the following things installed
 -> Ionic v3.0
 -> Nodejs
 -> Python 3
 -> MongoDb
 
2. Before executing server code, it must be ensured that a MongoDb instance is up and running. Which can done by following command
                                
                                "$ sudo systemctl start mongodb"
                                
**********STEPS TO START THE PROJECT***********

1. First the server needs to be initialised, which can be done by running the file "main.js" located at "YU-Major Project/Server/"
   with the following command
                                
                                "node main.js"
                                
2. After the server is up and running you need to run the device handler to monitor the gas data from atmosphere and for sending the
   same to the server. To run the handler code located at "YU-Major Project/RPI-Code/" , execute the following command from terminal
   after cd-ing into the directory.
                                
                                "python handler.py"
                                
    NOTE: Make sure you have the permission to access the port on which the device is connected else the handler will throw a permission error.
    
3. To run the mobile app code on your system you can run the ionic's development server by running the following command in the "YU-Major Project/YU/" directory.
                                
                                "ionic serve"
